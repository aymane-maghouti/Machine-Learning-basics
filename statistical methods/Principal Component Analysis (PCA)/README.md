# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a technique that allows dimensionality reduction of data while preserving as much information as possible. This method is often used to explore relationships between variables and individuals, and to identify underlying patterns or structures in the data.

In this simple exemple, we will use the Python library scikit-learn to perform PCA on a dataset of our choice(my dataset is given as Excel file).
