# Statistical Data Analysis using PCA, CA, and CCA

The statistical methods are all useful for exploring and analyzing complex and multidimensional data, by identifying structures, relationships, and associations between variables. They can be applied in different fields, and in our case we will focus on three methods:
            + Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [in French : Analyse en Composantes Principales (ACP)]
            + Correspondence Analysis (CA) [in French : Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances (AFC)]
            + Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) [in French : Analyse en Correspondances Multiples (ACM)]
