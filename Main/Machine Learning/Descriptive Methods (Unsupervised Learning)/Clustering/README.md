# Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that involves grouping similar data into different clusters or groups. The main objective of clustering is to find hidden structures in the data and group them based on their similarity.

There are different types of clustering algorithms that can be used depending on the characteristics of the data and the objectives of the analysis. The main clustering algorithms are:

K-means: The K-means algorithm is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. It involves partitioning the data into K clusters by minimizing the sum of distances between points and their cluster center. The cluster centers are iteratively adjusted until convergence is reached.

Hierarchical clustering: The hierarchical clustering algorithm is an algorithm that allows creating a hierarchy of clusters. There are two types of hierarchical approaches: agglomerative and divisive. The agglomerative approach starts with each point in its own cluster and merges clusters based on their similarity. The divisive approach starts with all points in a single cluster and divides clusters based on their dissimilarity.

DBSCAN: The DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) clustering algorithm is an algorithm that finds dense areas of points and extends them into clusters. It can find clusters of complex shapes and can handle data with noise and outliers.

Mean Shift: The Mean Shift clustering algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm that finds density modes of the data distribution. It works by shifting a set of data points towards a higher density area until a local maximum is reached.

Spectral Clustering: The Spectral Clustering algorithm is a graph-based method that uses the similarity matrix to partition the data. It projects the data into a lower dimensional space and uses the K-means clustering algorithm on the projected data.
