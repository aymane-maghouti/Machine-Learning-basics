#  Predictive methods (supervised learning)
Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where a model is trained from labeled data. In this type of learning, the model learns from examples of labeled data, that is, data where we know the correct answer (the target variable) associated with each observation.

The goal of supervised learning is to predict the target variable for new observations. The model learns from the sample labeled data and tries to generalize the relationships between the explanatory variables and the target variable to predict the correct values for new unlabeled data.

the supervised learning tasks are : 
        + regression
        + classification
        + recommendation
