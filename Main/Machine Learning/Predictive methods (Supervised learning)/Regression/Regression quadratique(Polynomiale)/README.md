# Polynomiale Regression
Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. Polynomial regression can be used when the relationship between the variables is not linear, but can be approximated by a polynomial function.

And here it is an example of the implementation of this method using python language and  some libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization and sk-learn which is an open source machine learning library for programming language Python.
