# Multiple Regression
Multiple regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between several independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. It is often used to predict or estimate the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

In a multiple regression, we seek to find a mathematical equation that relates the independent variables to the dependent variable. This equation takes the form of a straight line or a plane in a multi-dimensional space, depending on the number of independent variables. The coefficients in this equation quantify the strength and direction of the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.


And here it is an example of the implementation of this method using python language and some libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization and sk-learn which is an open-source machine learning library for programming language Python. The dataset which I work with is given as excel file
