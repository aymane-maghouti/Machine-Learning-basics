# Machine learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
Here it is the implementation of some machine learning algorithms as regression and classification (predictive methods) and clustering, association rules, outliersâ€™ detection (descriptive methods)
