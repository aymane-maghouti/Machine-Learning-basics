#  Desciptive methods (non-supervised learning)
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique where a model is trained on unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there is no correct answer associated with each observation.

The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden structures or patterns in data. The model tries to group the data based on their similarities, or find patterns in the data without needing a target variable.

the unsupervised learning tasks are:
         + Clustering
         + association rules
         + outlier's detection
