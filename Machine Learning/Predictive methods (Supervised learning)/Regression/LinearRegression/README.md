# Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a predictive method used to model the relationship between two quantitative variables by finding the best regression line that can explain the variation of the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable.

The simple linear regression model can be used for different purposes, including to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable, to assess the importance of the independent variable in the variation of the dependent variable, or to detect outliers or influential observations in the data.

And here it is an example of the implementation of this method using python language and  some libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization and sk-learn which is an open source machine learning library for programming language Python.
